simpler way to calculate height for usetransition (list of elements, see discord, measures height)
simpler usetransition hook
document values getting from use gesture
suggest to use frequency and damping but also see that article you sent
copy inertia's decay from popmotion twitter example and rubberband effect from alex holacheck slides
check if you still need devicepixelratio
there is usespringvalue, check discord where you can use it
consolidate docs from v8 migration and have a cookbook
